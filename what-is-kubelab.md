Let me explain KubeLab:

KubeLab is an interactive learning platform designed to teach Kubernetes through hands-on labs and challenges. Here are the key aspects:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Provides a gamified learning experience for Kubernetes
   - Users complete practical tasks in a real Kubernetes environment
   - Progress is tracked on a real-time leaderboard
   - Encourages learning through competition and immediate feedback

2. **Technical Architecture**:
   - Web-based platform built with Next.js and TypeScript
   - Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
   - Interactive terminal sessions for hands-on practice
   - API endpoints for user registration and progress tracking

3. **Key Features**:
   - **User Registration**: Users enter their name to start participating
   - **Real-time Leaderboard**: Shows participants' rankings and scores
   - **Task System**: Series of practical Kubernetes challenges
   - **Progress Tracking**: Automatically monitors task completion
   - **Interactive Terminal**: Provides hands-on access to Kubernetes clusters

4. **Learning Flow**:
   - Users register with their name
   - Complete Kubernetes tasks in order
   - Get immediate feedback on task completion
   - See their progress on the leaderboard
   - Compete with other participants

5. **Technical Components**:
   - Frontend: Modern UI built with shadcn components
   - Backend: API routes for user management and progress tracking
   - Infrastructure: Kubernetes environment for practical exercises
   - Real-time Updates: SSE for live leaderboard updates

The platform makes learning Kubernetes more engaging and practical by combining hands-on experience with gamification elements.
